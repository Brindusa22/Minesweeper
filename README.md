# MINESWEEPER
Minesweeper is a Python command line game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

It is a single-player puzzle game, a terminal version of the classic, well-known Minesweeper game, which can played on two board sizes,
depending on the palyer's skill level: beginner or advanced. The rows and columns are numbered so that the users
can easily choose the coordinates of the cell they want to uncover.

The live version of this project can be found (here).

## How to play

There are two levels of difficulty: beginer and advanced, which set the size of the board and the number of bombs accordingly.
After choosing the level, the objective is to uncover all the cells on the board, avoiding to hit any bombs.

The initial board contains cells whose content is hidden from the user.
The cells can contain bombs, whose location is randomly generated by the compuer, or numbers.

Players are prompted to uncover a cell by typing its coordinates(row and column). If the chosen cell contains a bomb, the game ends, the entire board is revealed and the playe loses. If the cell does not contain a bomb, it shows a number. This number represents the neighbouring bombs of that cell and is an important hint that helps the player choose the next move. If the cell does not have a neighbouring bomb, its number is 0 and the computer automatically uncovers all the cells around it, until a cell with neighboring bombs is found.

The game is won when all the cells that do not contain a bomb have benn revealed.
